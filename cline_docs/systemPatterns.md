# System Patterns

## Architecture

- Next.js App Router architecture
- Server and Client Components
- API Routes for backend functionality
- Static and Dynamic rendering options
- Middleware support

## Key Technical Decisions

1. Using TypeScript for type safety
2. Implementing Tailwind CSS for styling
3. ESLint for code quality
4. App Router for modern routing
5. src directory structure for better organization

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── app/             # App Router pages and layouts
├── components/      # Reusable React components
├── lib/            # Utility functions and shared logic
├── styles/         # Global styles and Tailwind config
└── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for all components and functions
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React Server Component patterns
- Use proper loading and error states
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind
- Follow ESLint rules for consistent code style
