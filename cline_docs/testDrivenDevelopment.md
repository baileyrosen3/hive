# Test Driven Development

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Testing

   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - Utility function testing with Jest
   - Type checking with TypeScript
   - Snapshot testing for UI components

2. Integration Testing

   - API route testing
   - Page navigation testing
   - State management testing
   - Form submission flows

3. End-to-End Testing
   - User flow testing with Cypress
   - Critical path testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Testing Frameworks

1. Jest

   - Default testing framework
   - Snapshot testing
   - Mocking capabilities
   - Code coverage reporting

2. React Testing Library

   - Component testing
   - User interaction testing
   - Accessibility testing
   - DOM queries and assertions

3. Cypress (Future Implementation)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Visual regression testing
   - Network request stubbing
   - Time travel debugging

## Test Cases

1. Component Tests

   - Render testing
   - Props validation
   - Event handling
   - State changes
   - Error boundaries

2. Page Tests

   - Route handling
   - Data fetching
   - SEO elements
   - Loading states
   - Error states

3. Utility Tests
   - Helper functions
   - Data transformations
   - API utilities
   - Type validations

## Testing Best Practices

1. Test Organization

   - One test file per component/utility
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Proper test isolation
   - Meaningful assertions

2. Testing Patterns

   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Don't test implementation details
   - Test user behavior
   - Mock external dependencies

3. Code Coverage
   - Maintain high coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Balance coverage with value
   - Regular coverage reports

## CI/CD Integration

1. Automated Testing

   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Block merges on test failures
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Performance benchmarking

2. Testing Environment
   - Consistent test environment
   - Proper test data
   - Environment variables
   - Cache management
